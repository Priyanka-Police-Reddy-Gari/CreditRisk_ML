# CreditRisk_ML

Business needs a Default Risk model. The model will be used in Credit Approval Decisioning, i.e. to decide whether to approve an application for a Credit Product.

Modeling team will build the model. Strategy team will use this modelâ€™s output to design a Credit Approval strategy. In this project, we will build this model and design a strategy in this project.

The data is taken from : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/data?select=train_data.csv
